Trackademix
===========

[Trackademix](http://trackademix.com) was developed as my project for [Insight Data Science](http://insightdataengineering.com) September through October 2014.

## Intro

**Trackademix** tracks scientific contributions and collaborations and portrays a more detailed picture 
than the standard author-document-date, author-document-date, etc. approach can. 
**Trackademix** examines the web of collaborators with whom a particular author has worked over the years.
This paints a broader picture than a simple listing of the co-authors on any given document.

Furthermore, as an author publishes his work, its relevance is typically determined by the number of citations made thereto.
A simple count of the citations is not as informative as examining a chronological history of the citations.
For example, two authors may have been cited 300 times over the last five years.
The first author had one paper cited 250 times and two others cited 25 times each.
The second author has six (6) papers cited 50 times each.
The citation profile is very different in both cases; **Trackademix** allows us to visualize the citation history. 
**TrackademiX** application harvests available information from the [ArXiv](http://arxiv.org), 
[INSPIRE HEP](http://inspirehep.net) and 
[NASA ADS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu) databases, 
filters out information unlikely to be part of the author''s scientific contributions history
